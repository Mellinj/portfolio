    <div class="mydescription">
            <span>My name is Dallin Johnson.  I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Elementary Education.
            I spent 3 years teaching 2nd and 3rd graders.  I have exposure to html and css.  I am currently attending (MATC) Mountainland Applied
            Technology College studying Web Programming and Development.  As part of the program I will
            be doing an externship.  I will be receiving my certification January 2018.  In my free time I like to watch movies and television shows, make home videos, listen to music,
            play around on the piano and the ukulele, I enjoy thinking, coming up with new ideas, traveling, and spending
            time with my wife and daughter.
